# high-five
The demo task I worked on.
Unity Version : 2019.1.0f2
*Note* Scripting Backend .Net 4x is used. (Although the project should run properly in older versions of Unity and in .Net 3x too).

Time Taken: This whole task presented in the project took me about 16 hours in total. But that was in chunks as I could barely spare time.


Was it Hard? 
The "sling" mechanic is missing in this code. As I was just stuck (not with how to do sling mechanic, that was not an issue) but how to use that mechanic in the current game. Apart from that, I felt nothing HARD as such. But the "sling" mechanic was quite difficult. Although, I think that I would be able to implement all the part of gameplay with ease. But, the finishing off of everything will be kind of detail work and thus can take some time. But hard? Not that much.
